# access-ac-labs-20220
Git repository used to collaborate with the students enrolled at the Access AC lab 2020

# How do we work
Each stundent has to: 
- fork this repository
- clone the forked repository
- add a folder with the full name, e.g., lastname_firstname
- add all the code and make chnages only to the folder that it added
- when there is something to me showned it will do another merge from the initial repository, make sure there are no conflicts and issue a merge request with summary of what has been implemented in that merge request
